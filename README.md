# Groceries_Project_2
h4 1. The customer must put name-able viriables into their online virtual shopping cart. The customer will have to put valid product names into the shopping cart, so if there is none of the product the customer would like to buy, they can send us a email saying they would like this product to be sold.

#### 2. The algorithm must now know how many of this product is in stock, the customer must choose how many they would want to buy. For example, if a customer buys 5 apples and there is 100 apples, then the algorithm must take away 5 from the 100 in the stock, so it must be updated to 95 apples left for the next customer that would like to buy apples. (If the customer wants to order more than 250 apples and there is only 100 and the customer orders receive those on the frist day, and on the second day they will receive the rest which is 150 apples.

#### 3. The customer must choose a way of payment, there is many ways to pay and it is all up to the customer.

#### 4. The next step to the algorithm is to choose product shipping options, so the customer can choose these options which is either mail to a mail post, delivery to front door or a pickup. The speed of the delivery will differ the price so the faster the higher price. The customer will now receive their virtual receipt. In the receipt the price date and time will be on it so the customer knows whens its the product is at their door step or mail.

#### 5. After the whole algorithm is done the staffs must ready the product for shipping and check if all the information about shipping is correct, The staffs must double check after the A.I algorithm. The adress of the customer, the name of the customer is now checked and finally the product is shipped to the customer must wait for it to be delivered.
##### - the staffs must double check after the A.I because the A.I's are not perfect so the A.I will make mistakes, and that is why the staffs must double check
